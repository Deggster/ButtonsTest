Project Animated Buttons
____________________________________

This project with a test button animations.

Scenes Overview:
________________
Scene 1: Simple Animated Button
Implements a basic button with a mask preview using Unity's Animator.
________________

________________

________________

________________
Scene 3: Dissolve Button with Particles
Introduces a dissolve effect button enhanced with particle effects, implemented using C# scripting.
________________

I didn't use URP or HDRP because the built-in shaders are more optimized for mobile devices, which is the target platform for games in a casual style.
